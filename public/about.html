<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello I am Fatima Ghannam a computer science student at BAU. I am currently working on my  web development skills and I hope one day I'll become professional in it.</p>
<p>I have enrolled in Dr.Angela Yu web development bootcamp since I am really intrested in web development especially the frontend part. So far, all the topics are intresting and I really recommend students who are intrested in web development to enroll in this course which is found on udemy.
<br />Link to the course:  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/37350000#reviews">Dr.Angela Web development course</a></p> 
<p>Also, I really like to help students like me with the information that I gained in computer science so far. If you're intrested I'll leave my information at the end of this website. <br />Have Wonderful Day ! Ciao <3</p>
